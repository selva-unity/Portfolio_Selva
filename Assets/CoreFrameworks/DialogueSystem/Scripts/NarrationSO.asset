      dialogue: Our hero, Aric Valiant, is the latest scion of this noble lineage.
        Born under the crimson glow of a blood moon, legends foretold that Aric would
        face challenges unlike any of his forebears. His father, King Alden, known
        as "The Benevolent", had forged alliances and kept peace within the borders
        of Eldoria. Yet, beneath the tranquility, whispers of ancient prophecies
        and hidden threats began to stir.
